# PySpark Streaming:
  
  Spark Streaming provides a high-level abstraction called discretized stream or DStream, which represents a continuous stream of data.
  
  Here in this small project I have coupled Apache Spark with Flume to demonstrate complete process of streaming
  of data transfer from local repository to hdfs as text file through Flume and subsequently it acts as input to Spark for streaming.
  Python is employed as programming language owing to short coding and syntax simplicity.
  
  Streaming Process execution steps are detailed out in 'PySpark Data Stream_execution steps.txt' file.
